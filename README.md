# Live hand tracking script

This is a simple project that walks you through building a real-time hand tracking script using Mediapipe and OpenCV. The script will detect your hand from your webcam and draw 21 hand landmarks.

## Requirements

You will need the following:

- Python 3.10+
- A webcam
- Mediapipe
- OpenCV

I recommend installing everything using `pip`:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate        # macOS / Linux
venv\Scripts\activate           # Windows

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run the script

```bash
python main.py
```

Press Q to quit.

Enjoy!
